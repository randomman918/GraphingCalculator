Follow the below instructions to setup everything for the class project. If you don't follow these guidelines and end up losing some of your work, that's on you and you'll have to redo it. Sorry :(

#####Getting Started

1. [Download Git.](https://git-scm.com/downloads) Git allows programmers to seamlessly share their project classes with the rest of their team, ensuring that no progress is lost and everyone can receive and up-to-date copy whenever they want. Note: If you're using a school computer, you should save this to your student data drive so you don't have to download it every time you turn on the computer.
2. Create your project folder. This folder will contain all the project files as well as the git repository. Again, if you're using a school computer you should create this in your student data drive.
3. [Create a GitHub Account.](https://github.com/join) This is required for both the group chat (below) and to use Git properly.
4. [Set Up Git.](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) This page is really helpful when it comes to using and setting up Git for the first time. During the first meeting Jake and Owen will be making sure everyone has succesfully set up Git.
5. Keep Everyone Updated. Although only Jake and Owen really need your code, everyone should be able to check it out and see what you're doing if they want to. Every time you make some major changes to your code, open up Git and use the following commands: 
```terminal
git add * 
git commit -m "Your message here. Describe the changes in one line or less."
git push
```

You should also "pull" all new changes people have made to your project folder every once in a while as well. "Pulling" from the GitHub repository basically just means updating your local project folder with the up-to-date remote project's contents. To do this, you can *usually* use the below commands:

```
git add * (Note: Only required if you've recently made changes without commiting them.)
git commit -m "Your message here. Describe the changes in one line or less." (Note: Only required if you've recently made changes without commiting them.)
git pull origin master
```

That's it! Using Git and GitHub will probably take some getting used to, but you'll get it. Also be sure to click the button below to join the "Gitter Chat", which is how we can all communicate about the project and whatever.
